                        I am an aspiring data professional with a keen interest in fields like data science, data analysis, and data engineering. 
                        While I enjoy full-stack development, I am still building my confidence in that area. 
                        However, as the saying goes, <span id="spanned">“You are what you seek to become,”</span> and I am determined to continue growing and learning. <br>
                        <br>In addition to my technical pursuits, I have a passion for writing poetry, especially during challenging times. 
                        It’s a unique hobby that I turn to not in moments of joy, but in the face of adversity or heartache, when words become a way to process and heal.
